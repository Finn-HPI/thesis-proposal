There are many papers about SIMD Sorting.
In \cite{Watkins} a new way of sorting with AVX512 is proposed, based on Merge Path \cite{MergePath}, which
is over 5x faster than a quicksort and 2x faster than Intel's IPP library sort. They assume 32-bit data, so they can
fit 16 elements in one SIMD register. In comparison for a Sort-Merge Join we would at least need a 64-bit for each
entry assuming tuples (key, rowId) with key and rowId being 32-bit. Therefore, we can only fit 8 instead of 16 values.
