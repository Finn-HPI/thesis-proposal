Chhugani et al. \cite{10.14778/1454159.1454171} describe the concepts 
needed for efficient SIMD sorting for both single- and multi-core execution, including sorting
networks, bitonic- and odd-even merge networks, and how to deal with memory bandwidth limitations 
for large problem sizes through multiway merging. There are other ideas like MergePath \cite{MergePath}
for merging a few very large sublists in parallel and SIMD accelerated.
Kim et al. \cite{10.14778/1687553.1687564} implemented a sort-merge join using SSE intrinsics using these same 
concepts, projecting performance for wider SIMD widths that would outperform hash joins. Albutiu 
et al. \cite{MPSM} present MPSM, a sort-merge join implementation using their custom sorting routine
without SIMD, concluding that their sort-merge join
implementation is faster than the respective hash join implementation of Blanas et al. \cite{10.1145/1989323.1989328}. 
Balkesen et al. \cite{Balkesen} experimentally studied the performance of sort-merge and radix-hash join.
They claim to provide the fastest in-memory join processing algorithms using sorting and hashing,
and that sort-merge join gets more comparable in performance to radix-hash join with very large 
input sizes. Still, they conclude that the radix-hash join exceeds the sort-merge join for 256-bit
SIMD. The same authors claim that their parallel radix-hash join is the most efficient hash-join
implementation yet \cite{6544839}. The hash join operator
implemented in Hyrise is also based on \cite{6544839} and \cite{Balkesen}. 

None of the papers mentioned above take advantage of 512-bit SIMD. 
There is research on SIMD sorting using AVX-512 \cite{Watkins, 8855628}. To the best of our knowledge,
no literature exists on implementing sort-merge join with the same optimizations and concepts like
multiway merging for AVX-512.
