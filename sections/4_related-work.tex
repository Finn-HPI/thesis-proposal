% Description of related work in literature or other projects (theses, master projects, etc.).
Several papers describe how SIMD-accelerated sorting can be done efficiently on modern multi-core architectures.
Chhugani et al. \cite{10.14778/1454159.1454171} describe the concepts 
needed for efficient SIMD sorting for both single- and multi-core execution. MergePath \cite{MergePath}
presents an algorithm for merging a few very large sublists in parallel.
Kim et al. \cite{10.14778/1687553.1687564} implemented a sort-merge join using SSE intrinsics,
projecting performance for wider SIMD widths that would outperform hash joins. Albutiu 
et al. \cite{MPSM} present MPSM, a sort-merge join implementation 
without SIMD, concluding that their sort-merge join
implementation is faster than the hash join implementation of Blanas et al. \cite{10.1145/1989323.1989328}. 
Balkesen et al. \cite{Balkesen} experimentally studied the performance of sort-merge and radix-hash join.
They claim to provide the fastest in-memory join algorithms using sorting and hashing.
Still, they conclude that the radix-hash join exceeds the sort-merge join for 256-bit
SIMD. They also claim that their parallel radix-hash join is the most efficient hash-join
implementation yet \cite{6544839}. The hash join operator
implemented in Hyrise is also based on \cite{6544839} and \cite{Balkesen}. 

None of the papers mentioned above take advantage of 512-bit SIMD. 
There is research on SIMD sorting using AVX-512 \cite{Watkins, 8855628}, but to the best of our knowledge,
no literature exists on implementing sort-merge join with the same optimizations and concepts like
multiway merging for AVX-512.
