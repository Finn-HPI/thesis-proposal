\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Traditional database systems have historically been designed for systems and architectures where
I/O dominates performance. However, modern processors with multi-core architectures, advanced 
instruction sets, and other hardware accelerants like vector operations (SIMD) have significantly 
altered this landscape. Today's in-memory database systems are no longer I/O bound and, therefore,
need high intra-operator parallelism to utilize the multi-core architecture fully. To achieve
maximum performance, cache locality, NUMA awareness, and using SIMD instructions for higher data
parallelism should be considered.
The join operator is a fundamental component of every database system.
In recent years, the difference in performance between the sort-merge and radix-hash join has been
the subject of ongoing debate. Kim et al. \cite{10.14778/1687553.1687564} projected that Sort-Merge Join would outperform hash-based
alternatives with a factor of $1.35$ â€“ $1.65$ with 512-bit SIMD. Albutiu et al. \cite{MPSM} reinforced this claim with recent results reporting that
their NUMA-aware implementation of sort-merge join is superior to that of hash joins (without
leveraging SIMD). Balkesen et al. \cite{Balkesen} experimentally show contradicting results by implementing 
optimized versions for sort-merge and radix-hash join, showing that their implementation of
radix-hash join is still superior. They use AVX2 in their implementation, allowing further
work to explore wider SIMD registers (e.g., AVX512).

Despite ongoing research, public implementations of join algorithms optimized for modern hardware
are hard to find. Most existing implementations are proprietary or experimental, limiting their
accessibility and usefulness to the research community and database developers. An open-source,
state-of-the-art implementation of a sort-merge join optimized for different architectures would
help address this need. Such an implementation serves as a valuable baseline for researchers
looking to evaluate or improve upon existing methods, and it also contributes to advancing database
system design by providing a solid foundation for future innovation.
